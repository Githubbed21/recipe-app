## Description

- This is a react app that allows a user to search through out JSON database for recipes. The use can search using key meals such as breakfast, lunch or dinner. The user can also search a more narrow scope and enter in a name of meal where the code will filter out anything that doesn't match the requested name and only show the ones that match.

- A user can feel free to share their own recipes with the world by simply selecting the "Share a Recipe" route. The page will reload and display a section where they can
- enter the name of their meal
- select the corresponding meal of the day from a drop down box
- input the directions to make the meal
- import a image of the meal

One the user submit their recipe it will automatically be saved into our JSON date and rendered right into the recipes page!
